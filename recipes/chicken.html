    <h1>Chef John's Nashvile Hot Chicken</h1>
   
    <p>
        If you've never had Nashville Hot Chicken, we're talking about mouthwateringly, ultra-crispy, fiery fried chicken with a cayenne-infused glaze, and by 'glaze' I mean melted butter and lard. While i've never been to Nashville myself, this recipe works well for me. Serve chicken pieces on white bread and brush with extra sauce if you like. Serve with pickles.
    </p>

    <p>
        You don't need to travel to Tennessee to enjoy delicious Nashville hot chicken. This crispy, spicy, fried chicken will make the best chicken sandwich you've ever had in your life. Be sure to reserve the extra sweet-and-spicy sauce — it's so good, you'll want to keep adding it to the chicken (even if your mouth is already feeling fiery hot).

    <h2>How To Prepare</h2>

    </p>

    <h3>Bread the Chicken</h3>

        Remove the chicken from the marinade and blot dry. Toss the chicken in a flour and salt mixture, then place the chicken back in the marinade until coated. Dredge the chicken again in the flour mixture. Let the coating dry for 15 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Make the Hot Sauce</h3>

    <p>
        Combine the butter, lard, cayenne pepper, brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and pepper over medium-high heat. Cook until the fat melts. Keep the sauce warm until ready to use. 
    </p>

    <h3>Fry the Chicken</h3>

    <p>
        Fry the chicken on each side until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. Transfer the chicken to a rack to drain, then brush with more sauce. Serve on a piece of white bread (or bun) with pickles and reserved sauce.
